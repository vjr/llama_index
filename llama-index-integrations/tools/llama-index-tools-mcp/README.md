# MCP ToolSpec

This tool connects to MCP Servers and allows an Agent to call the tools provided by MCP Servers.

This idea is migrated from [Integrate MCP Tools into LlamaIndex](https://psiace.me/posts/integrate-mcp-tools-into-llamaindex/).

## Usage

This tool has a more extensive example usage documented in a Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/llama-index-integrations/tools/llama-index-tools-mcp/examples/mcp.ipynb).

This tool is designed to be used as a way to call the tools provided by MCP Servers.
